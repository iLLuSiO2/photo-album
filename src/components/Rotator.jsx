                <p>This was the time when I came to stay at your home for a few months. I couldnt be happier that I can spend a lot of days with you. But Not Surpriisingly, U got a job. It was hurtful but neccessary for your career. Even though I couldn't be helpful at that time I wanted to do my absolute best to cheer you up. As we caame closer to Sivakasi, my heart got emptier. But then I thought that I shouldn't be sad that I won't be able to see u anymore, I should be grateful that we atleast got a few days together</p>

                <p>Lots of nights I wondered what I should do to survive it. I usually watch a football match or watch a show or go for a walk to spend it. With you, I don't have to think about how to survive the night but rather how slow the night should pass. This was the time when you were taking care of yourself a lot, applying turmeric before sleeping. You were pretty adorable and I wouldn't miss the chance of capturing it. The more I think about it the more I wish to be able to survive more nights together. </p>

                <p>After a really long time you got to have a vacation and you went to Madurai for a week. Although you would've came home after a week, I could'nt stop myself from seeing you. Only after my decisions I then got to face its consequences. My mom got pretty angry that I was going to Madurai just for you. Among the choas, I still dont regret going there for u. We went to chitappa's Grave, then a Church, then ate somewhere in an auto and this was a bridge which looked really pretty but it is not visible because of your fat body covering it. </p>

                <p>The Infamous reception of Ajisha which was pretty exhausting. You and Moni were fighting for a few days for this stupid weird dress. Even though I thought it would look not soo great, U made it look awesome. You were stealing the spotlight even though you weren't the bride.</p>

                <p>After you went away for your first job, I just couldn't stop missing you. Even though there were Moni and Aji in the house I just couldn't stop thinking about you. I had tons of expectations and you not being there with me killed it. But still in those times of our long distance relationship, We talked everyday. That was easily the best part of those days. Somewhere I still miss the relationship and love that we had in those times for each other. Hopefully we continue to be people who talk to each other all the time regardless of being together or not.</p>

                <p>When you were living a new experience in Chennai, with abundance curiosity and interest in how you were living I wanted to visit you. But your work came between the plans ruining my interest compeletely. I remember you telling me that you won't be able to come to visit our short trip. Just when we went to eat somewhere else, Surprisingly you were there. Although we were together for only a several hours, that was memorable. Sucks that it was the only time we met for a whole year and hoping that we meet as much times as possible.</p>

                <p>The day where u were gonna start living alone. I can tell you were feeling pretty upset about staying away from your family. A sorrowful day where you got teary eyed and made me feel anxious and low. Looking back at those tough times it just feels surreal how much time has passed away.</p>

                <p>Those times when we used to walk almost everyday was seriously better than therapy. Every morning we carried out walking for a few miles not doing anything else but talking all the way. It is easily one of my favorite moments with you. Even when I am alone in Mumbai walking at night by myself, I keep thinking about you. Its really really really sad that this tradition has died and we dont do it anymore. I miss that a lot.</p>

                <p>Once on a Wonderfully perfect day, we went to walk besides the Padmanadapuram palace. I remember vividly we went to eat wada on a local hotel outside. We circled around the whole palace and even went beyond that. Even though its not anything grand, talking to you, exploring places like this with you gave me some of the happiest memories of this lifetime. And the singular reason for all of that is YOU.</p>

                <p>When I killed my curiosity seeing the mountain behind your area. Even though the way was not neat or proper, I liked it that way. It made me more curious and adventurous. Taking a bath in that water with everyone was really awesome. Also I look really cute and innocent in this pic.  </p>

                <p>After years of begging to you to visit Bombay, U finally made it. Even before 2-3 months, it was all I could think about. Like where should I take you, which part of my life should I show you, where should we go for walking in the morning. The expectations took a weird turn when you were not well. Although we went to the park behind and had a great time there, taking tons of photos while feeding each other Panipuri which u dont like.</p>

                <p>Just hours before you were leaving after a really short time in Bombay. We talked a lot in the morning. Although both of us wont remember what we talked about, it was heartwarming that such a sweet time was about to end. </p>

                <p>This was it!! At the airport, saying our final Goodbyes and kisses. It was really heart breaking, but I told myself that I shouldn't be sad that its ending, I should be happy that it happaned. Although it was funny how you missed your flight, It was really exhausting for me. Got happy that you can stay another day, but felt more pathetic knowing that it won't happen. It was tiring, but in the end we were apart from each other. I felt sorry that I couldn't do more to make you happy on your stay. This was the day I decided to make something like this for you.</p>

                <p>Hahahaa!! Never loved you more. Throughout my stay in Nalumavadi, I was thinking about a way to convince my parents somehow to see you. Since my sister was also there with me, I couldn't find a reason. I talked with you whenever I got time. You asked for my ticket and I refused it, eventually I sent it to you on the last day. I thought we were leaving tomorrow so you will not be able to do much. Being the idiot you are, you made a stupid and unexpected decision to come see me. It was just for a hour and you recieved many scoldings for it which I still feel guilty about. But from the bottom of my heart, you visiting me was the best thing happened to me this year. It short but sweetest, ILY </p>
